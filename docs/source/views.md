# Views

Views contain a class that inherits from `UnicornView` for the component's Python code.

To follow typical naming conventions, the view will convert the component's name to be more Pythonic. For example, if the component name is `hello-world`, the template file name will also be `hello-world.html`. However, the view file name will be `hello_world.py` and it will contain one class named `HelloWorldView`.

This allows `Unicorn` to connect the template and view using convention instead of configuration. Using the `startunicorn` management command is the easiest way to make sure that components are created correctly.

## Example view

```python
# hello_world.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class HelloWorldView(UnicornView):
    pass
```

## Class variables

`Unicorn` will serialize/deserialize view class variables to JSON as needed for interactive parts of the component.

Automatically handled field types:
- `str`
- `int`
- `Decimal`
- `float`
- `list`
- `dictionary`
- [`Django Model`](django-models.md#model)
- [`Django QuerySet`](django-models.md#queryset)
- `dataclass`
- `Pydantic` models
- [Custom classes](views.md#custom-class)

### A word of caution about mutable class variables

Be careful when using a default mutable class variables, namely `list`, `dictionary`, and objects. As mentioned in [A Word About Names and Objects](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/classes.html#tut-object) defining a mutable default for a class variable can have subtle and unexpected consequences -- it _will_ cause component instances to share state which is usually not the intention.

```python
# sentence.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

# This will cause unexpected consequences
class SentenceView(UnicornView):
    words: list[str] = []  # all SentenceView instances will share a reference to one list in memory
    word_counts: dict[str, int] = {}  # all SentenceView instances will share a reference to one dictionary in memory

    def add_word(self, word: str):
        ...
```

The correct way to initialize a mutable object.

```python
# sentence.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class SentenceView(UnicornView):
    words: list[str]  # not setting a default value is valid
    word_counts: dict[str, int] = None  # using None for the default is valid

    def mount(self):
        self.words = []  # initialize a new list every time a SentenceView is initialized and mounted
        self.word_counts = {}  # initialize a new dictionary every time a SentenceView is initialized and mounted

    def add_word(self, word: str):
        ...
```

`list`, `dictionaries`, and objects all run into this problem, so be sure to initialize mutable objects in the component's `mount` function.

### Class variable type hints

Type hints on fields help `Unicorn` ensure that the field will always have the appropriate type.

```python
# rating.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class RatingView(UnicornView):
    rating: float = 0

    def calculate_percentage(self):
        assert isinstance(rating, float)
        print(self.rating / 100.0)
```

Without the `float` type hint on `rating`, Python will complain that `rating` is a `str`.

### Custom class

Custom classes need to define how they are serialized. If you have access to the object to serialize, you can define a `to_json` method on the object to return a dictionary that can be used to serialize. Inheriting from `unicorn.components.UnicornField` is a quick way to serialize a custom class, but it uses `self.__dict__` under the hood, so it is not doing anything particularly smart.

Another option is to set the `form_class` on the component and utilize [Django's built-in forms and widgets](validation.md) to handle how the class should be deserialized.

```python
# hello_world.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView, UnicornField

class Author(UnicornField):
    def mount(self):
        self.name = 'Neil Gaiman'

    # Not needed because inherited from `UnicornField`
    # def to_json(self):
    #    return {'name': self.name}

    class HelloWorldView(UnicornView):
        author = Author()
```

```html
<!-- hello-world.html -->
<div>
  <input unicorn:model="author.name" type="text" id="author_name" />
</div>
```

```{danger}
Never put sensitive data into a public property because that information will publicly available in the HTML source code, unless explicitly prevented with [`javascript_exclude`](views.md#javascript_exclude).
```

## Class properties

### template_name

By default, the component name is used to determine what template should be used. For example, `hello_world.HelloWorldView` would by default use `unicorn/hello-world.html`. Set `template_name` inside `Meta` to override it.

```python
# hello_world.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class HelloWorldView(UnicornView):
    class Meta:
        template_name = "unicorn/hello-world.html"
```

```{note}
Setting `template_name` directly as a class attribute also works and is supported for backwards compatibility.
```

### template_html

Template HTML can be defined inline on the component instead of using an external HTML file. Set it inside `Meta`.

```python
# hello_world.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class HelloWorldView(UnicornView):
    class Meta:
        template_html = """<div>
    <div>
        Count: {{ count }}
    </div>

    <button unicorn:click="increment">+</button>
    <button unicorn:click="decrement">-</button>
</div>
"""

    ...
```

```{note}
Setting `template_html` directly as a class attribute also works and is supported for backwards compatibility.
```

## Instance properties

### component_args

The arguments passed into the component.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
{% unicorn 'hello-arg' 'World' %}
```

```python
# hello_arg.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class HelloArgView(UnicornView):
    def mount(self):
      assert self.component_args[0] == "World"
```

### component_kwargs

The keyword arguments passed into the component.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
{% unicorn 'hello-kwarg' hello='World' %}
```

```python
# hello_kwarg.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class HelloKwargView(UnicornView):
    def mount(self):
      assert self.component_kwargs["hello"] == "World"
```

### Passing a Django Form

A Django `Form` (or `ModelForm`) instance can be passed directly from a template into a unicorn component as a keyword argument. The form will be available in the component's template context for rendering, but it is automatically excluded from the JSON state sent to the browser (since forms cannot be serialized to JSON).

```html
<!-- index.html -->
{% unicorn 'my-form-component' form=my_django_form %}
```

```python
# my_form_component.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class MyFormComponentView(UnicornView):
    form = None  # will hold the passed-in form instance

    def mount(self):
        # self.form is available here on the initial render
        pass
```

```html
<!-- unicorn/my-form-component.html -->
<div>
  <form method="POST">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button unicorn:click="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</div>
```

```{note}
Because forms cannot be pickled, `self.form` will be `None` on subsequent AJAX
interactions (after the initial page load). If you need to process submitted form
data reactively, declare a `form_class` on the component and use
[component validation](validation.md) instead.
```

### request

The current `request`.

```python
# hello_world.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class HelloWorldView(UnicornView):
    def mount(self):
        print("Initial request that rendered the component", self.request)

    def test(self):
        print("AJAX request that re-renders the component", self.request)
```

### force_render

Forces the component to render. This is not normally needed for the current component, but is sometimes needed when a child component needs a parent to re-render.

```python
# filter.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class FilterView(UnicornView):
    search = ""

    def updated_search(self, query):
        self.parent.load_table()

        if query:
            self.parent.books = list(filter(lambda f: query.lower() in f.name.lower(), self.parent.books))

        # Forces the parent to re-render instead of just the current child component
        self.parent.force_render = True
```

## Custom methods

Defined component instance methods with no arguments (other than `self`) are available in the Django template context and can be called like a property.

```python
# states.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class StateView(UnicornView):
    def all_states(self):
        return ["Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", ...]
```

```html
<!-- states.html -->
<div>
  <ul>
    {% for state in all_states %}
    <li>{{ state }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
{% endverbatim %}
```

:::{tip}
If the method is intensive and will be called multiple times, it can be cached with Django's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/utils/#django.utils.functional.cached_property">`cached_property`</a> to prevent duplicate API requests or database queries. The method will only be executed once per component rendering.

```python
# states.py
from django.utils.functional import cached_property
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class StateView(UnicornView):
    @cached_property
    def all_states(self):
        return ["Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", ...]
```

:::

## Instance methods

### mount()

Gets called when the component gets initialized or [reset](actions.md#reset).

```python
# hello_world.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class HelloWorldView(UnicornView):
    name = "original"

    def mount(self):
        self.name = "mounted"
```

### hydrate()

Gets called when the component data gets set.

```python
# hello_world.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class HelloWorldView(UnicornView):
    name = "original"

    def hydrate(self):
        self.name = "hydrated"
```

### updating(property_name, property_value)

Gets called before each property that will get set. This can be called multiple times in certain instances, e.g. during a debounce.

### updated(property_name, property_value)

Gets called after each property gets set. This can be called multiple times in certain instances, e.g. during a debounce.

### resolved(property_name, property_value)

Gets called after the specified property gets set. This will only get called once.

### updating\_{property_name}(property_value)

Gets called before the specified property gets set. This can be called multiple times in certain instances, e.g. during a debounce.

### updated\_{property_name}(property_value)

Gets called after the specified property gets set. This can be called multiple times in certain instances, e.g. during a debounce.

### resolved\_{property_name}(property_value)

Gets called after the specified property gets set. This will only get called once.

### calling(name, args)

Gets called before each method that gets called.

### called(name, args)

Gets called after each method gets called.

### complete()

Gets called after all methods have been called.

### rendered(html)

Gets called after the component has been rendered.

### parent_rendered(html)

Gets called after the component's parent has been rendered (if applicable).

## Meta

Classes that derive from `UnicornView` can include a `Meta` class that provides some advanced options for the component.

### exclude

By default, all public attributes of the component are included in the context of the Django template and available to JavaScript. One way to protect internal-only data is to prefix the attribute name with `_` to indicate it should stay private.

```python
# hello_state.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class HelloStateView(UnicornView):
    _all_states = (
        "Alabama",
        "Alaska",
        ...
        "Wisconsin",
        "Wyoming",
    )
```

Another way to prevent that data from being available to the component template is to add it to the `Meta` class's `exclude` tuple.

```python
# hello_state.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class HelloStateView(UnicornView):
    all_states = (
        "Alabama",
        "Alaska",
        ...
        "Wisconsin",
        "Wyoming",
    )

    class Meta:
        exclude = ("all_states", )
```

### javascript_exclude

To allow an attribute to be included in the context to be used by a Django template, but not exposed to JavaScript, add it to the `Meta` class's `javascript_exclude` tuple.

```{note}
Django `Form` and `ModelForm` instances are **automatically** excluded from the
JavaScript context — you do not need to add them to `javascript_exclude`.
```

```html
<!-- hello-state.html -->
<div>
  {% for state in all_states %}
  <div>{{ state }}</div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```

```python
# hello_state.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class HelloStateView(UnicornView):
    all_states = (
        "Alabama",
        "Alaska",
        ...
        "Wisconsin",
        "Wyoming",
    )

    class Meta:
        javascript_exclude = ("all_states", )
```

### safe

By default, `unicorn` HTML encodes updated field values to prevent XSS attacks. You need to explicitly opt-in to allow a field to be returned without being encoded by adding it to the `Meta` class's `safe` tuple.

```html
<!-- safe-example.html -->
<div>
  <input unicorn:model="something_safe" />
  {{ something_safe }}
</div>
```

```python
# safe_example.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class SafeExampleView(UnicornView):
    something_safe = ""

    class Meta:
        safe = ("something_safe", )
```

````{note}
A context variable can also be marked as `safe` in the template with the normal Django template filter.

```html
<!-- safe-example.html -->
<div>
  <input unicorn:model="something_safe" />
  {{ something_safe|safe }}
</div>
```
````

### login_not_required

By default, every component requires the user to be authenticated when Django's
[`LoginRequiredMiddleware`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/middleware/#django.contrib.auth.middleware.LoginRequiredMiddleware)
is active (Django 5.1+). Set `login_not_required = True` inside the `Meta` class to allow
unauthenticated users to interact with the component on public pages.

```python
# newsletter_signup.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class NewsletterSignupView(UnicornView):
    email = ""

    class Meta:
        login_not_required = True

    def subscribe(self):
        ...
```

```{note}
`Meta.login_not_required` has no effect on Django versions older than 5.1 because
`LoginRequiredMiddleware` was not available before that release.
```

```{warning}
Only set `Meta.login_not_required = True` on components whose actions are safe to
execute without authentication. Any sensitive operation (e.g. accessing private
data, modifying records) should still verify `self.request.user.is_authenticated`
inside the relevant component methods.
```

### template_name

Override the template path used to render the component.

```python
# hello_world.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class HelloWorldView(UnicornView):
    class Meta:
        template_name = "unicorn/hello-world.html"
```

### template_html

Define the component template as an inline HTML string instead of a separate file.

```python
# hello_world.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class HelloWorldView(UnicornView):
    count = 0

    class Meta:
        template_html = """<div>
    <div>Count: {{ count }}</div>
    <button unicorn:click="increment">+</button>
</div>"""
```

### component_key

Set a default key for the component class. This is applied when the template tag
does not supply a `key=` argument and is useful when you always want a specific
component to be keyed the same way.

```python
# signup.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView

class SignupView(UnicornView):
    class Meta:
        component_key = "signup"
```

```{note}
A `key=` value provided in the template tag always takes precedence over
`Meta.component_key`.
```

### form_class

Attach a Django form for validation. Errors from the form are merged into the
component's `errors` dict.

```python
# book_form.py
from django_unicorn.components import UnicornView
from .forms import BookForm

class BookFormView(UnicornView):
    title = ""
    year = None

    class Meta:
        form_class = BookForm
```

```{note}
Setting `form_class` directly as a class attribute also works and is supported for
backwards compatibility.
```

## Pickling and Caching

Components are pickled and cached for the duration of the AJAX request. This means that any instance variable on the component must be pickleable.

```{warning}
Do not store unpickleable objects (e.g. generators) on the component instance.
```

If you need to use an unpickleable object, either convert it to a pickleable type (e.g. convert a generator to a list) or re-initialize it within the method that needs it without storing it on `self`.

```{note}
Django `Form` and `ModelForm` instances are handled automatically — they are stripped
from the component before pickling and restored afterwards, so passing a form as a
template kwarg (see [Passing a Django Form](#passing-a-django-form)) will not cause
pickling errors. The form will be `None` after a cache restore (i.e. on subsequent
AJAX requests).
```
